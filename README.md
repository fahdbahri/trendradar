```

#### Note: You can include your favorite resources in `src/services/list_sourcs.py` Example:

```bash

        sources = []

    
        news_sources = [
                'https://techcrunch.com/',
                'https://www.dailyrotation.com/',
                'https://currentai.news/'
        ]
        sources.extend(news_sources) 
        
        # Reddit API 
        if client_id and client_secret and client_user:
            reddit_sources = [
                "https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/",
                "https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/",
